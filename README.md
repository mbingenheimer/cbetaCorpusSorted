# CBETA Corpus Sorted

This are files from the CBETA Corpus v. 2021, made available here: https://github.com/DILA-edu/CBETA_TAFxml, sorted into Indian-Chinese and Chinese-Chinese texts as preparation for various NLP tasks focusing on comparing texts translated or produced in China between 500 and 800 CE.

2021-07: Sorted c.660 Indian-Chinese and c.290 Chinese-Chinese texts translated or written between 500 and 800 CE. The Indian-Chinese collection contains more files but less text. The files in the Chinese-Chinese collection are longer on average.

2022-05: Transformed the xml files from the CBETA github repository to clean text files for training and analysis (see the two tar.bz2 archives).
